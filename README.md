**Discussion Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG)** is a local, privacy-focused tool designed to help educators quickly and efficiently answer discussion questions using their course materials, such as syllabi and lecture notes. It leverages cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to generate accurate and context-aware responses. By running entirely offline, dRAG ensures that sensitive student data stays under your control, making it a secure choice for academic environments.
## Environment Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### 1. Ensure Prerequisites are Installed

Before creating the Conda environment, ensure that the following prerequisites are installed on your system:

- **Make:** Required for building some of the packages. The installation method depends on your operating system:
  - **Linux:** You can typically install `make` via your package manager, for example, `sudo apt-get install make` on Debian/Ubuntu.
  - **macOS:** `make` can be installed with Homebrew using `brew install make`.
  - **Windows:** Consider using a package manager like Chocolatey (`choco install make`) or installing Make for Windows.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8:** Required for GPU support and compiling CUDA packages. Installation methods vary by operating system:
  - **Linux:** Follow the [official Linux installation guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux) provided by NVIDIA, selecting the appropriate version and distribution.
  - **macOS:** CUDA support for macOS is limited and may not be available for newer versions. Check the [CUDA Toolkit archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-cuda-toolkit-developer-tools-mac-hosts) for compatibility.
  - **Windows:** Use the [official Windows installation guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows) to download and install the toolkit suitable for your system.

### 2. Create Conda Environment

Create a Conda environment named `ENVNAME` with Python 3.10. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
conda create -n ENVNAME python=3.10
```

### 3. Activate Conda Environment

Activate the newly created Conda environment:

```bash
conda activate ENVNAME
```

### 4. Install Required Python Packages

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Install `llama-cpp-python` with Custom CMake Arguments

The installation of `llama-cpp-python` with CUDA support is optional but recommended. If you want CUDA support, set the `CMAKE_ARGS` environment variable before installation. The steps vary slightly between Linux/Mac and Windows.

#### For Linux and Mac:

Run the following command in your terminal to enable CUDA support:

```bash
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" pip install llama-cpp-python
```

#### For Windows:

Open PowerShell and execute the following commands:

```powershell
$env:CMAKE_ARGS = "-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"
pip install llama-cpp-python
```

### 6. Install `llama-cpp-haystack`

Finally, install the `llama-cpp-haystack` package:

```bash
pip install llama-cpp-haystack
```

### 7. Install PyTorch with CUDA Support

To utilize GPU acceleration in certain tasks, it is recommended to install PyTorch with CUDA support. You can install the appropriate version of `torch` for your CUDA version by following the instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Additional Notes:

- Replace `ENVNAME` with your preferred environment name.
- While using Conda is not required, it is highly recommended for managing dependencies and ensuring consistent environments.

## First Run Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the llama3 Model:** Run the following command to download the llama3 model from HuggingFace into the `/models` directory.

   ```bash
   python model_download.py
   ```
2. **Prepare Source Documents:** There is an existing `/source_documents` folder at the root of the project directory containing an `example.pdf` file. Move your files into this folder and delete the example.pdf file.
3. **Clear Example Data:** Before ingesting new documents, delete the `/chromaDB` folder to remove old embeddings. This folder contains example embeddings for `example.pdf`.
4. **Ingest Documents into ChromaDB:** Run the following command to ingest the documents in `/source_documents` using ChromaDB.

   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```
5. **Generate Answers from Prompts:** Execute the following command to generate answers from `input.json` in `/documents/input`. The results will be serialized and saved in `/documents/generation_output`:

   ```bash
   python generate.py
   ```
6. **Evaluate LLM Answers: (CURRENTLY NOT WORKING)**
   Finally, run the evaluator script. You'll be prompted to provide your `OPENAI_API_KEY` for this step. This script evaluates LLM answers to prompts, and the results will be serialized in `/documents/evaluation_output`:

   ```bash
   python evaluator.py file_name.json
   ```
   Note: Only provide the file name. The script will handle appending the directory of `/documents/generation_output`

## Subsequent Runs


- **Adding Documents:** If you add new documents to `/source_documents`, delete the `example.pdf` file (if present), and the `/chromaDB` folder, then rerun the `ingest.py` script to process these new documents.
- **After Ingestion:** Following any run of `ingest.py`, rerun `generate.py` and `evaluator.py` to ensure that your answers and evaluations are up-to-date with the latest document set. Ensure the `generate.py` outputs are correctly named for use in `evaluator.py`.
- **Changes to `generate.py`:** If you make modifications only in `generate.py`, it necessitates a rerun of `evaluator.py` to evaluate any new or altered prompts. Be sure to pass the appropriate file name from `/documents/generation_output` to `evaluator.py`.
- **Modifying Evaluation Metrics:** Should there be any changes to the evaluation metric in `evaluator.py`, rerunning `evaluator.py` alone suffices to apply these changes to your evaluation results. Ensure you provide the correct input file name to `evaluator.py`.
